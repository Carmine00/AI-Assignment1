# AIRO2 Assignment 1
This project was developed at the University of Genoa in the academic year 2022/2023 during the Artificial Intelligence for Robotics II course.
From the specifications of an automated coffee shop, a domain in the PDDL+ language was designed in order to solve the given problems.

Installing and running
----------------------
Since the planning engine ENHSP is written in JAVA, it is advised to first install JAVA 15 and then run the script that will compile the engine and launch the domain with the problems.
``` bash
$ git clone https://gitlab.com/enricos83/ENHSP-Public/-/tree/enhsp-20?ref_type=heads
$ sudo apt-get install openjdk-15
$ ./run.sh
```
